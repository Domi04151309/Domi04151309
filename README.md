### About Me 🧑🏻
I am interested in programming and I think that developing new things is a lot of fun.
My programming skills are average, but I can do quite a lot with them.
Taking and editing pictures is something I like as well, which is why you will find some on Instagram.
You can redistribute most of my projects and/or modify them under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation.
Improvement suggestions are always welcome, so if you want to make some feel free to do it.
