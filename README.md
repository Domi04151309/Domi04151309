### Hi there, I'm Dominik 👋

### About Me 🧑🏻
I am interested in programming, and I think that developing new things is a lot of fun.
You can help developing most of my projects and become a part of the open-source community.
Improvement suggestions are always welcome, so if you want to make some feel free to do so.
